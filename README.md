# Deploying a Banking Application on AWS

## 1. Introduction:
The goal of this project was to deploy a 3-tier banking app using Terraform for infrastructure as code and Jenkins for CI/CD automation. In response to specific challenges faced during manual deployments, this approach was adopted to enhance consistency, collaboration, and the overall quality of deployments.

## 2. Infrastructure Overview:

### VPC Configuration:
- CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
  - Custom VPC provides isolation and security for applications  
- 2 public subnets in separate AZs
- Internet gateway for public subnet internet access
- 2 Ubuntu 18.04 t2.micro EC2 instances for build server and application isolation

### Security Groups:
- **Jenkins SG:**
  - Opens port 8080 and 22
- **App SG:**
  - Opens port 8000 and 22

## 3. Purpose and Benefits:
By embracing Terraform and Jenkins, our team aimed to achieve several significant benefits:
- **Scalability:** Seamlessly scale infrastructure based on demand for optimal performance during high traffic periods.
- **Security:** Implement robust encryption protocols, user access controls, and network security policies.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitate teamwork through version-controlled infrastructure as code, enabling effective collaboration among team members.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure easy maintenance and updates of infrastructure components, leading to improved system stability and reduced downtime.
